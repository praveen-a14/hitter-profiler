# hitter-profiler
As a data science intern for Kinetic Performance Institute in Morgan Hill, CA, created an RShiny App that outputs a dashboard with multiple helpful data points and visualizations based on a youth hitter's raw data collected at the KPI facility. The dashboard also contains comparisons to age group average in order to aid coaches and players with player development at KPI.
